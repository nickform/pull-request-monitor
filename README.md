## Introduction

Pull requests have made code review a much more practical part of software development but it can still be tricky to strike the right balance between not interrupting other team members when a review is required and not being held up too long while waiting for a review. While [Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/) provides email notifications for pull requests, in a team where each developer generates one or more per day, these can pile up in your inbox and get stale fast.

Pull request monitor sits in your system tray continuously displaying the count of active pull requests in the configured VSTS project. Left click the icon to bring up a view of the active pull requests, right click to access the settings window or to close the app.
